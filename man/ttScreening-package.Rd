\title{
Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Sites Screening by Use of Training and Testing Samples
}
\description{
 A screening process to filter out non-informative DNA methylation sites by applying (ordinary or robust) linear regressions to training data, and the results are further examined using testing samples. Surrogate variables are included to account for unknown factors.

This package utilizes training and testing samples to filter out uninformative DNA methylation
sites. Surrogate variables (SVs) of DNA methylation are included in the filtering process
to explain unknown factor effects.
